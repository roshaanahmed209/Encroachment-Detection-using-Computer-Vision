properly integrate the files i can see the in encroachment.py there are paths from kaggle used. remove those paths and update it that on the image is input from user it should should be processed using model_infer_gm.py then the segmentation results of that shuld along with the input image should be saved in a folder " from_web_1" and then the matching_algorithm.py should run and find the most nearest matching pattern of segmentation masks to the input of user once found it, the founded image and segmentation and the input user input image with its segmentation should be passed to encroachment where it deetects encroachment and displays the results on result.html with accuracy and the number of red segmentations 

once i am on the loading screen while running the web app it just keeps me there it is not going to the result screen after the processing is complete it is stuck there, once the processing is complete it should go to the result page automatically
